# Biography

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, advised by Prof. Philip S. Yu. 

My research interests lie in Machine learning, Data Mining, Computer Vision and Optimization. I concentrate on deep learning on structured data, such as graph, spatio and temporal data.
